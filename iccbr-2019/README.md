# myCBR Benchmark Projects
## These projects were created for the paper "A Data-Driven Approach for Determining Weights in Global Similarity Functions" 

These projects are generated from datasets available on the UCI repository.

The global and local similarity measures can be found in the myCBR projects, which can be revised for comparision and research experiments, with the help of myCBR-Workbench tool (for more details on myCBR tools refer to: _Bach K, Mathisen BM, Jaiswal A. Demonstrating the myCBR Rest API. In ICCBR Workshops 2019 (pp. 144-155)_.
